  "details": "An Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability in the Advanced Forwarding Toolkit Manager daemon (aftmand) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). On the PTX10008 and PTX10016 platforms running Junos OS or Junos OS Evolved, when a specific SNMP MIB is queried this will cause a PFE crash and the FPC will go offline and not automatically recover. A system restart is required to get the affected FPC in an operational state again. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 22.1 version 22.1R2 and later versions; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 21.3-EVO version 21.3R3-EVO and later versions; 21.4-EVO version 21.4R1-S2-EVO, 21.4R2-EVO and later versions prior to 21.4R2-S1-EVO; 22.1-EVO version 22.1R2-EVO and later versions prior to 22.1R3-EVO; 22.2-EVO versions prior to 22.2R1-S1-EVO, 22.2R2-EVO.",
