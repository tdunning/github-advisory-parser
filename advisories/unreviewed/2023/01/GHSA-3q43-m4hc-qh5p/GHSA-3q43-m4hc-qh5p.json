  "details": "InHand Networks InRouter 302, prior to version IR302 V3.5.56, and InRouter 615, prior to version InRouter6XX-S-V2.3.0.r5542, contain vulnerability CWE-760: Use of a One-way Hash with a Predictable Salt. They send MQTT credentials in response to HTTP/HTTPS requests from the cloud platform. These credentials are encoded using a hardcoded string into an MD5 hash. This string could be easily calculated by an unauthorized user who spoofed sending an HTTP/HTTPS request to the devices. This could result in the affected devices being temporarily disconnected from the cloud platform and allow the user to receive MQTT commands with potentially sensitive information.",
