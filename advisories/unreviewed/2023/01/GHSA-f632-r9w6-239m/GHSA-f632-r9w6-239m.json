  ],
  "details": "The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59, due to due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'wpr_ajax_search_link_target' parameter in the 'data_fetch' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is occurring because 'sanitize_text_field' is insufficient to prevent attribute-based Cross-Site Scripting",
